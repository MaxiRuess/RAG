# RAG
 

## Introduction
-------------
In this Repo I'm testing different RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation) techniques. 
Most of the Files are wrapped in a streamlit application so you can run the files with `run streamlit ... ` to test them out. 

I'll be adding more stuff over time here




## Dependencies 
-------------

1. Install dependencies `requierements.txt `
2. Create .env file and store your  `OPENAI_API_KEY ` and `HUGGINGFACEHUB_API_KEY` if you want to use other models and embeddings other than OPEN AI


## Usage 
-------------

1. run the File that you want to run
